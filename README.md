# MoonTale

MoonTale creates personalized bedtime stories for children, combining reading, imagination and gentle language exposure.

## Status

MoonTale is an early-stage web prototype. It is currently used for active user testing and validation, and is deployed as a static website through GitHub Pages.

Live website: https://moontaleapp.com

## Main Features

- Personalized bedtime-story builder
- Multiple interface languages
- Gentle vocabulary exposure
- Parent-selected themes and goals
- Local browser storage for story previews
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile use
- Accessibility considerations such as semantic HTML, skip links, labels, and live status regions

## Supported Languages

- English
- Polish
- Spanish
- French
- German

## Technology Overview

- Semantic HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- GitHub Pages
- Formspree for form submissions
- Google Analytics, currently loaded with Google tag ID `G-716GP23C93`

MoonTale does not require a build step to run in production. The development tooling in `package.json` is optional and exists only for formatting checks and lightweight logic tests.
The JavaScript is organized as browser ES modules, with page-specific entry points under `assets/scripts/pages/`.

## Local Development

Because the site is static, you can preview it by opening `index.html` in a browser.

For a closer GitHub Pages-style preview, run a simple local static server from the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8080/
```

Optional formatting tools:

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run format:check
npm run format
```

Do not run formatting across the whole repository unless you have reviewed the resulting diff.

## Manual Testing Checklist

Test the main user flow before publishing changes:

1. Open `index.html` and confirm the homepage loads with styling and images.
2. Open `personalized-bedtime-stories-for-kids.html` and confirm links to the homepage and story builder work.
3. Open `story-builder.html`.
4. Choose each supported interface language and confirm the interface updates.
5. Fill in the story builder form and create a story.
6. Confirm `story.html` opens and displays the generated story.
7. Confirm the generated story follows the selected current language.
8. Confirm the waitlist forms still point to the existing Formspree endpoint.
9. Confirm `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` are reachable from the site root.

## Contribution Workflow

Use a branch for every change. Avoid committing directly to `main`.

Recommended branch examples:

- `feature/separate-language-files`
- `fix/story-language-generation`
- `refactor/css-architecture`
- `docs/improve-readme`

Use clear, scoped commit messages:

- `feat(i18n): add language configuration`
- `fix(builder): restore continue button validation`
- `refactor(css): separate builder styles`
- `docs: improve project setup guide`
- `test(story): verify selected story language`

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for more detailed guidelines.

## Known Limitations

- Story generation currently runs in the browser using local templates and browser storage.
- Interface language, narrative language, and learning language are resolved separately. Invalid or missing learning-language values fall back to Spanish after validation, and the fallback is exposed in story metadata.
- Automated tests cover language resolution, translation fallback, safe storage parsing, vocabulary selection, and story generation.
- Form submissions depend on the configured Formspree endpoint.
- Language support is limited to the languages listed above.
- The prototype should not be treated as medical, developmental, or educational advice.

## Product Roadmap

High-level areas under consideration:

- More robust story quality controls
- Improved language and vocabulary configuration
- Better saved-story management
- More structured accessibility testing
- A clearer separation between content, translations, and application logic
